My Portfolio Website

My project is a simple portfolio website that showcases my skills and work experience. I chose to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript because I have a strong foundation in those technologies and enjoy creating new things with them. One of the challenges I faced was making the site fully responsive across different devices, but I overcame this through trial and error. In the future, I plan to add links to some of my previous projects and include some pictures to make the site more visually appealing.
